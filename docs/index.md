## Why?

Convenience. Software development has been undergoing a mass exodus from Monolithic Architecture towards MicroServices since 2009. There are excellent reasons to do so. Such as

- _Inner outer_ architecture
- _shadow traffic_
- or protection of brand damage when defects escape into production.

Such convenience results in exponential scaling of complexity while simultaneously translating what was previously internal dependencies into external guarantees.

At even 50 to 100 MicroServices, It is **no longer** realistic for humans to manage operations, updates, data synchronization & configuration. So we turn to technology stacks such as Kubernetes to assist, yet they are as complex if not more so than most MicroService stacks.

Cyvive as an **Operational Platform** simplifies this web of entanglement. One interface, full dependency & life-cycle management in any Kubernetes cluster on any cloud or bare metal technology.

Manage one, hundreds, or federated multi-cloud cluster with built-in disaster resilience for your MicroServices. Better yet, run Kubernetes direct on your own metal at over 2,500 nodes safely, or multi-mesh production clusters securely. Even extend your operations from Cloud Computing to Edge Computing and beyond into Fog Computing anywhere in the world from a single control plane. Its all part of Cyvive's standard modus operandi. Allowing you to:

> Cyvive the Cloud via Immutable Change

## What?

Cyvive, simply is **Immutable Change**, applied through all **Cloud Native** layers and beyond. This means your business, or parts of it can be reproduced, moved or upgraded safely. Cyvive enables this through:

### Immutable Operational Platform

Infrastructure-as-a-Service, expects the cloud service provider to deliver infrastructure components that would otherwise exist in an on-premises data center. These components could consist of servers, storage and networking as well as the virtualization layer, which the (Cloud Service Provider CSP) IaaS provider hosts in its own data center. While they may also provide Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) offerings such as cloud functions, container execution API's, or even Kubernetes variations. By design, they are not turn-key offerings.

**Cyvive**, however, is. As an operational platform, it directly interfaces with the cloud provider (or Bare Metal) of choice using the provides IaaS interactions to provision an immutable collection of components necessary to run the orchestrator of choice. The default being Kubernetes

### Autonomic Governance

**Cyvive**, streamlines all complexities through dynamic dependency graphs, an industry standard configuration & communication syntax, release management, configuration and version management for MicroServices through to Infrastructure.

Any part of your infrastructure can be deployed on-demand, with all relevant dependent services, in any environment.

## How?

We worked with 3 Universities, and over 35 industry publications to analyse trends and approaches to modelling, scaling, interacting and managing MicroService deployments at diabolical scale. The result was the release of [**The Language of the Fog**](http://www.foggyubiquity.com/language) the core configuration language of **Cyvive**, a direct extension of natural descriptive language used in companies today.

We also cross partnered to understand and explore each part of the **Cloud Native** EcoSystem to architect and craft a well-balanced blend of services capable of supporting over 2,500 nodes with 500 containers each. (Yes, Cyvive has been applied to managing over 1 million containers)

We pushed _immutability_ down to the operating system, every machine self registers, and is managed exclusively by **Cyvive**. There is no human access available to the actual machine. Making **Cyvive** inaccessible to human error.

### Production Ready

While **Cyvive** is orchestrator independent, it has been actively used with Kubernetes since version 1.6.x (March 2017)

## Where?

- All Major Public Clouds
- AMD64 / ARM64 Chipsets
- Bare Metal (**Cyvive** creates its own cloud on metal)
