title: Cyvive ~ EcoSystem
description: Understanding the EcoSystem of Third Party Components Cyvive Utilizes

## In Relation to Cloud Native

[Cloud Native Computing Foundaton (CNCF)](https://www.cncf.io/) maintains an up to date [interactive landscape](https://landscape.cncf.io/) of applications that are providing some functionality within the five layer scope of Cloud Native Architecture. Kubernetes, being a graduate project of CNCF contains significant modularization capabilities. Some are even expected to be provided externally (i.e. Networking and Monitoring).

**Cyvive** doesn't exist in isolation. As part of extending and optimizing Kubernetes, assessments are carefully undertaken to identify 'Best In Breed' candidates for replacement of standard Kubernetes components, or extensions. While the preference is to utilize 'Best In Breed' from CNCF Landscape and wider industry this is not always possible. And as most are aware, 'Best In Breed' solutions change over time.

As such **Cyvive** maintains a this record of our current 'Best In Breed' suggestions to include in Cyvive's suggested EcoSystem.

## Mandatory or Optional

Each part of the EcoSystem is what we believe to be a 'Best In Breed' recommendation or suggestion. They are exactly that, optional components that can be included or excluded at installation and upgrade time. **Cyvive** at this time doesn't offer bundle pricing, so selection to install a propriatory EcoSystem part would incur costs between you and the provider directly.

The EcoSystem exists because each part offers significant benefit to process, administration, understanding or acceleration of the software management lifecycle. As such, its typically a good idea to include as much of it as possible when using **Cyvive**

Additionally, as **Cyvive**'s recommendations change over time the installer or upgrader scans your cluster for an older recommendation prior to implementing a new one and where possible suggests upgrade paths.

All recommendations are date stamped as to the last time they were assessed

## Additional Assessment Information

Every Enterprise has different requirements for accepting recommendations from an EcoSystem. As such while we try to maintain a transparent comparison on each page, more in-depth information on specific recommendations is available upon request to paying customers.

### EcoSystem

**Cloud Native** requires a collection of tools, or an extended ecosystem of services to understand and, unlock and leverage its full potential. Each tool, when selected by companies typically goes through a process, that takes months for an efficient team with multitudes of Proof of Concepts, each potentially causing *back to the drawing board moments*. The modern company doesn't have the luxury of time to assess, stabilize and incrementally add each component of the **Cloud Native** ecosystem while guaranteeing stability amongst change management in their Digital Transformation journey.

**Cyvive** takes the best in breed tool for each part of the EcoSystem and manages its lifecycle. Choices are available between Open Source or Propriatory where possible. Such careful selection and management of the Best in Breed Candidates of the EcoSystem unlocks the power of the Orchestrator to perform often significantly beyond its standard capabilities

### Cloud Agnostic

It is no longer a realistic expectation that companies can enhance their technology stack by partnering with a single cloud provider. With the growing multitude of high quality cloud providers, each offering niche tools a multi-cloud strategy is a necessity.

**Cyvive**'s detailed Governance and Operational Capabilities allow rapid movement of workloads between cloud providers at an unprecidented scale. It is now a realistic expectation that every hour your entire company can be migrated between clouds based on lowest instance pricing. Without disruption of service.
