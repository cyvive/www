    This functionality was originally offered by the parent company as a separate product **Fathomable**. It is undergoing consolidation into **Cyvive**'s core and is restricted to _beta_ customers at this time. Please contact your account manager via live-chat should you wish to participate.

Applications / Services / Components / Functions are all descriptors for various complexity and integration levels of code. While each could exist in isolation, more often than not an _architectural_ approach is selected for logical separation of business processes both internal and external.

When an architecture is introduced, its necessary for **governance** to also co-habitiate to ensure that the software solutions within an organization adhere to the defined policies, guidelines, and standards that are defined as a function of the objectives, strategies, and regulations applied in the organization.

The challenge lies around development velocity and ironically management of **governance** itself as companies progress through the technology layers defined in the [OSIMM V2 Model](http://www.opengroup.org/soa/source-book/osimmv2/p2.htm). Specifically Layers 4 - 7 where each technological progression results in exponentially exploding the number of managed code assets.

**Cyvive.io** is a Solution Oriented Infrastructure technology capable of operating at Layer 4 - 7 though governance via policy. It is:

- **cloud agnostic**
- **container orchestrator independent**
- **Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY)**
- **Capable of Managing / Deploying entire companies / business units / applications**
- **Dependency Management Aware**
- **Cloud Function Ready**
- **12 Factor Compliant**
- **Developmer & Governance Friendly**
- **Extensible**
- **Highly Flexible**
- **Academically; Enterprise & Startup compatible**
